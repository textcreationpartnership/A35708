            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103503:15"/>for a pretty while, then the Deponent ſaw her ſpread a Cloath upon her Lap, and laid the end of it over the Bed-clothes, and then fetch a Child (as the Deponent firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, for he could not then ſee it,) out of the Bed into that Cloath, and give it to Mrs. <hi>Labadie,</hi> who brought it round to the ſide where the Deponent ſtood, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it into a little Room, into which the Deponent imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately followed the King, and ſaw her ſit down by the Fire, and heard her ſay, It is a Boy; upon which the King ſaid, let me ſee it; thereupon ſhe laid open the Cloath, and ſhewed all the Child, ſaying, There's what you wiſh to ſee; The Deponent doth not charge his Memory with the very Words, but the ſenſe of what he heard. The Deponent looked upon the Child at the ſame time, which appeared to be very foul. This Deponent deſireth pardon if he doth not know the proper Expreſſion, but hopes his meaning is plain.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103503:17"/>that a Medicine was mentioned among the Ladies for a certain Remedy againſt Convulſions: It was, ſome drops of blood from the Navel-ſtring; the <hi>Deponent</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted Sir <hi>Thomas Witherley</hi> and the other Phyſicians; and to ſatisfie the Women, it was allowed of; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as was conceived, no danger in the thing.

               <p>Now for the Time of the Queens Conception, ſhe often told the <hi>Deponent</hi> and others, That She had two Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; one, from <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 6th. of <hi>September,</hi> when the King return'd from His Progreſs to the Queen then at <hi>Bathe;</hi> and the other, from <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 6th. of <hi>October,</hi> when the Queen came to the King at <hi>Windſor;</hi> but for ſome Reaſons the <hi>Queen</hi> rather reckoned from the latter; though afterward it proved juſt to agree with the former.

               <p>UPon <hi>Trinity Sunday, 10th. June</hi> 1688. I went to St. <hi>James</hi>'s Houſe about Nine a Clock in the Morning, and followed my Lord Chancellor, through the Lodgings to the Dreſſing Room, next to the Queens Bed-Chamber, where divers Lords of the Council were met upon occaſion of the Queens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Labour, the King came ſeveral times into the Room, and amongſt other things was pleaſed to tell us, that the Queen came exactly according to her firſt Reckoning, which was from the Kings Return from his Progreſs, to <hi>Bathe</hi> in <hi>September</hi> 1687. After this the Counſellors were ordered to come into the Bed-Chamber, and I ſtood on that ſide of the Bed, that had the Curtains drawn open, I heard Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty Cry out ſeveral times. I ſtaid in the Room du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Birth of the Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> I ſaw him car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the little Bed-Chamber, whither the King, the Lords and my ſelf in particular did follow him.</p>

               <p>I Had the Honor to be in the King's Chamber in the Morning, when word was brought him, the Queen was not well, and followed him into the Dreſſing Room next Her Majeſties Bed-Chamber, where I ſtaid till His Majeſty called me to come in, which was about the beginning of her Pains. I Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Compaſſion I had for Her Majeſty, hearing her Crys, made my ſtay there very uneaſie, One of the laſt eſpecially ſeemed to me ſo Sharp, as it really forced me for a little time to ſtop my Ears with my Fingers to avoid hearing more of the like; when ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them at Liberty, I heard no more, but perceived a ſuddain ſatisfaction in the Faces of the Aſſiſtance, ſeveral ſaying, that the Queen was Delivered, and
